## About Me
### 👋 Hi, I’m **Ebadullah Jamal**

## Interests
### 👀 I’m interested in specifically coding computer languages such as **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, etc.

## Learning
### 🌱 I’m currently learning and mastering **Python**.

## Collaboration
### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve **Python development**, web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript), or creative coding applications.

## My Email
### 📫 You can reach out to me by emailing at **ebadullahjamal394@gmail.com**

## Fun fact
### ⚡The first-ever computer programmer was **Ada Lovelace** in the 1840s! She wrote an algorithm for **Charles Babbage's** Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer. What's even cooler? The computer itself was never fully built, but her program was essentially the world's first piece of code!

## Motivation  
### 💪 Every great coder was once a beginner who didn’t quit. Keep pushing, keep learning, and remember—every bug you squash today is a step closer to becoming the developer you aspire to be. Your journey is uniquely yours, and every line of code you write adds to your story.

## My Motivation
### 🔥 ***Set your goals high, take that first step, and keep pushing forward. Every small effort today builds the foundation for the extraordinary tomorrow you deserve.***
